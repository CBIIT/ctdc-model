  program:  
    Desc: <WORK NEEDED HERE> Within the Clinical Trial Data Commons, projects and studies/trials are grouped into discrete programs, based upon the origins and/or scientific nature of each project or study/trial. These programs may or may not directly relate to any formal program, e.g. NCI funding programs. The Program node contains the properties required to appropriately characterize any given CTDC program.

  program:  
    Desc: Within the Clinical Trial Data Commons, projects and studies/trials are grouped into discrete programs, based upon the origins and/or scientific nature of each project or study/trial. These programs may or may not directly relate to any formal program, e.g. NCI funding programs. The Program node contains the properties required to appropriately characterize any given CTDC program.

  data_file:
    Desc: Data files can be associated with CTDC project, study, participant, diagnosis and specimen records, but are not themselves stored within the application. Instead, the application stores records as to the existence and nature of such data files. The Data File node is comprised of properties which characterize these files in terms of their size, format and content, such that they can be appropriately represented within the application’s UI, and in terms of their storage location, such that they can be retrieved for analysis.

The Cancer Moonshot Biobank is a longitudinal study that collects pre- and post-treatment biospecimens and associated data from participants who are undergoing standard of care treatments in medical institutions across the US. By looking at samples and information collected from the same people over time, researchers can better understand how cancer changes over time and over the course of medical treatments."
